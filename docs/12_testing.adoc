.End to End (e2e) Test
It consists of testing an application from the point of view of the end user.

* Unauthenticated history: the unauthenticated user tries to access the history and it appears empty.
* Unauthenticated Purchase: the unauthenticated user attempts to make a purchase and is redirected to the login page.
* User Authentication: the unauthenticated user tries to authenticate and is redirected to the profile page, where they can see their details such as name, address and company.
* Authenticated Purchase: the authenticated user makes a purchase and is redirected to the history where it is reflected.

Note: they can only be executed locally.

.Gatling Test
Gatling is a Web application load testing tool that allows you to generate tests very easily. We have conducted tests for two different scenarios.

* scenario 1: a sudden user peak of 1500 users is introduced, to observe how the application reacts to the sudden increase in requests.

* scenario 2: more complete scenario where several stress peaks are simulated followed by application recoveries, to observe how our application recovers from these stress peaks.
