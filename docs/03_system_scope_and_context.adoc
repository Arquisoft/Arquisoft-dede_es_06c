== System Scope and Context

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
System scope and context - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners
(neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

.Motivation
The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.

.Form
Various options:

* Context diagrams
* Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.

*DeDe* is a web application focused on allowing users to buy used vehicles, ranging from simple bicycles all the way to automobiles.
Clients will be able to browse and buy different vehicles they like on our web, as long as they have signed up, and are signed in. They will need to provide our services with a billing address and payment method in order to let us process their purchase.

=== Business Context

.Contents
Specification of *all* communication partners (users, IT-systems, ...) with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces.
Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication protocols.

.Motivation
All stakeholders should understand which data are exchanged with the environment of the system.

.Form
All kinds of diagrams that show the system as a black box and specify the domain interfaces to communication partners.

Alternatively (or additionally) you can use a table.
The title of the table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.

We have clients who want to buy used vehicles. The clients need to sign up in order to use the application. The vehicles are registered into the database by Administrator users. They can also remove said vehicles. Orders are used to link a buyer with the vehicle, or products that they are buying, and will be shipped to their home.

The data in exchange is simple. The client will be able to see information about the vehicle and products, they will be able to see a representative name, price and images. The store will need the clients' full name, billing address, age, username and a password to store their information. At least a payment mean will be needed for the client to be able to make purchases.
The seller (the application, in this case), on the other hand, will receive the client's billing address, so as to be able to ship the package, as well as their full name in order to recognize them.

=== Techincal Context

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation with I/O uses which channel.

.Motivation
Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.

The application will be deployed online, and will be accessible through any modern web browser. To develop its frontend we will be using React. We will use MongoDB as our database, and we will link the backend and frontend with Express. The application will be writen in TypeScript, a JavaScript extension, so to speak, that lets programmers use a very similar syntax to that of JS, but will allow us to avoid common mistakes through the use of static type checking. 

We will be using the Solid architecture, with the objective of protecting our users' information, only giving access to the data they want to provide us, which will be necessary for us to process their purchases.

The main objective of this system is to provide users who want to buy used vehicles a safe space to use for this purpose, where only the information they want to share is used, and especially not taken from them. Every purchase they make will be stored in our database, but is not our property. This means, if at any given time a client decides to hide this information from us, they are in their right.

|===
|*System* |*Utility*
| Solid | We use Solid to protect our users' private information.
| MongoDB | It allows us to store the data regarding clients, orders, and products.
| TypeScript | The language chosen to code the system and give it all its functionality.
| Express |JavaScript library that allows us to link the database with the frontend.
| React | JavaScript library used to create the frontend. It is based on components.
