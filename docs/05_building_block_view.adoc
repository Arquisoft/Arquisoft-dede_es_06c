== Building Block View
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes,
interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations,
datas structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)
This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the floor plan.
.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.
This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.
.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.
image:05_building_blocks-EN.png["Hierarchy of building blocks"]
Level 1 is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.
Level 2 zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.
Level 3 zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.

=== Level 1 Whitebox Overall System
:imagesdir: images/ 
image:Level1.png["Whitebox Overrall System"]

Motivation::

Dede application is the general structure of a system in which users will have the possibility to send their deliveries to any place they want and check and be updated of their state. 
All the data that belongs to the user is stored safely in their POD's.

Contained Building Blocks::
[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
|Name| Description
|User | Client of the application which will interact with it
|Dede | System developed to be used by the users. Through it information in the PODs will be taken.  
|Pod's service| Has the aim to access each user personal pod
|===

=== Level 2

:imagesdir: images/ 
image:Level2.png["Level2"]

Motivation::

Shows how the application will work internally in general terms. The client through the interface will get the data requested by using the Data Access layer.


Contained Building Blocks::
[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
|Name| Description
|User Interface | The user will interact with this interface to request any information about the deliveries or program any service.
|Data Access | The layer that will provide and request information from and to the pods and the database
|MongoDB | Database used to stored the minimum data needed from the users
|===

=== Level 3

:imagesdir: images/ 
image:Level3.png["Level3"]

Motivation::

Detailed structure of the system application. Focused in the components of the User Interface and Data Access.


Contained Building Blocks::
[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
|Name| Description
|Views | Parts of the application which the user is going to interact with during experience with the system
|Home |  Initial screen for the application
|Shop | View where all the products are show 
|Shopping cart | The user has a shoppin cart where he will can see the products previosly selected and change the amount of the product.
|Log in |  Here the user will log in into their personal account if they have previously created one
|History | Here the user can find any information related with their deliveries, like their state or details
|Log out | It signs out the application from the last user.
|Restapi | The application asks the restapi for the information needed and this asks and returns it from the MongoDB.
|MapboxAPI | It obtains the address of the logged in user, for each kilometer of distance from this address with respect to our headquarters (University of Oviedo) 10 euros more are added for shipping costs.
|WebStorageAPI | The Web Storage API provides mechanisms by which browsers can store key/value pairs, in a much more intuitive fashion than using cookies.
