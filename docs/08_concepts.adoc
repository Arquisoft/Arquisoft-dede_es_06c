== Cross-cutting Concepts

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are
relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as
* domain models
* architecture patterns or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions
* implementation rules
.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity)
of the architecture. Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.
Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks
(e.g. security or safety). This is the place in the template that we provided for a
cohesive specification of such concepts.
.Form
The form can be varied:
* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)
.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:
* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts
Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

.Domain Model

.Domain Concepts
* User: interface that groups the generic behaviors of a user.
* SuperUser: user administrator of the application. It has special permissions such as adding or deleting products and viewing the list of all existing users in the database.
* StandardUser: standar user of the application. They store their data in PODs.
* POD: stores the data of each of the user.
    - username (primary key): user account login name.
    - password: user's access key to his account.
    - organization: organization to which the user belongs.
    - name: user's real name.
    - address: user's delivery address.
* ShoppingCart: virtual shopping cart where products are stored.
    - products: list that contains all the existing products in the shopping cart.
    - totalPrice: cumulative price of all products in the shopping cart.
* History: user purchase history.
    - id (primary key): identification of the product in relation to the user. Necessary to add to the history table.
    - username: user account login name.
    - product_name: product designation.
    - product_type: product category.
    - product_price: price of the product.
* Product: each of the products available in the online store.
    - name: product designation.
    - type: product category.
    - price: total price of the product.

.User Experience Concepts
This application requires the user to register in order to authenticate and place an order. For this purpose, a registration form will be available, in which the user will have to fill in a series of data including a password that he/she will then have to use in the authentication form to access his/her personal account.
Once authenticated the user will be able to access the list of products that can be added to the cart and then make the purchase.

.Security Concepts
One of the objectives of the application, since it is an online sales system, is customer security. In order to guarantee this aspect, a procedure is used in which each user will have a password with which he/she can access his/her account.
In addition to this, PODs (Personal Online Datastore) are used to store all user data, so they are in a trusted environment.

."Under-the-hood" Concepts
SOLID principles are used to store the user data.

.Operational Concepts
* Shopping cart: you can look at the products you currently have in your shopping cart and delete them from there.
* History: it is possible to review personal purchase history.
* Products view: in this view you can see all the available products and add them to the cart from there.

.Usability
In order to offer a good user experience, the application is designed to be easily navigable and with a friendly interface.

.Sections Under Construction
* Architecture and Design Patterns
* Additional Libraries
* Acessibility
* Development Concepts
