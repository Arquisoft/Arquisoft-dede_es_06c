Once authenticated the user will be able to access the list of products that can be added to the cart and then make the purchase.

.Security Concepts
One of the objectives of the application, since it is an online sales system, is customer security. In order to guarantee this aspect, a procedure is used in which each user will have a password with which he/she can access his/her account.
In addition to this, PODs (Personal Online Datastore) are used to store all user data, so they are in a trusted environment.
