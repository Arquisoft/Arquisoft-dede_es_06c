== Runtime View
In this section, we will develop the main runtime views of use cases of our application.

=== Sign Up
The customer will be able to navigate freely in the store without having to be registered, 
but in case he wants to buy a vehicle he must register.
The client will be asked to enter their personal data, if this data is already registered in the database, 
the registration will be canceled and the log in window will be displayed. On the other hand, 
the customer's data will be saved in the database and access to make the purchase will be allowed.

=== Log In
Both the client and the administrator will see the option to log in, selecting the Solid provider they are using, they will be redirected to said site and log in there,
for this they must enter their username and password, if they are registered in the database, 
the system is loaded corresponding to their role and access is allowed, otherwise they will be denied access.

=== Buy Product
The client selects all the elements that he is going to buy, they are placed in the shopping cart, which is session-bound, meaning once the user logs out, it will be emptied. Once the client finishes the order and clicks the "buy" button, a new order is made that must be registered in the database.
If there is no problem, a confirmation message will be sent.

=== Registration Product
The administrator will be the only one capable of registering a new vehicle, 
for this he must enter the data about the vehicle.
The vehicle will be added to the database, once the vehicle registration is finished, 
an internal message will be sent to the products window and it will be updated immediately.
The user will be able to see the updated list of products without any problem.

=== Product Deletion
The administrator is the only user able to delete products by entering the product code.
The product is checked to see if it exists in the database, and if it does, it will be deleted. The product view is then updated and the deleted product will not appear.
Obviously, you cannot purchase a deleted product.

=== Adding a Superuser
In order to have an administrator, we need to register one in the System. We check if the user exists. If so, we update their status as a superuser on the database. After this, they will have permission to add and delete products. 'Superuser' is the same as 'Administrator'.

=== Deleting a Superuser
If the application has too many administrators, it could be an option to delete some from the System. We check if the user exists and it isn't the only administrator. If so, the administrator will be deleted. If else, an error will be sent to the System.
