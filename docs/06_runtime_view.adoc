== Runtime View
In this section, we will develop the main runtime views of use cases of our application.

=== Sign Up
The customer will be able to navigate freely in the store without having to be registered, 
but in case he wants to buy a vehicle he must register.
The client will be asked to enter their personal data, if this data is already registered in the database, 
the registration will be canceled and the log in window will be displayed. On the other hand, 
the customer's data will be saved in the database and access to make the purchase will be allowed.

=== Registration Product
The administrator will be the only one capable of registering a new vehicle, 
for this he must enter the data about the vehicle.
The vehicle will be added to the database, once the vehicle registration is finished, 
an internal message will be sent to the products window and it will be updated immediately.
The user will be able to see the updated list of products without any problem.

=== Product Deletion
The administrator is the only user able to delete vehicles by entering the vehicle code.
The vehicle is checked to see if it exists in the database, and if it does, it will be deleted. The product view is then updated and the deleted product will not appear.
Obviously, you cannot purchase a deleted vehicle.
